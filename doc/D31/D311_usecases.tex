\section{Human-Robot Interaction within the Use Cases}

The uses cases defined in the document D5.2 requires different forms of interaction between the robots and the users. In this section, we describe in details such interactions for every use case.

\subsubsection*{Use Case 1.1: Simple interaction and advertising}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}

\hline

{\bf Robot  $\rightarrow$ Customer} &
\begin{minipage}{11cm}
\vspace{1em}
Once the robot has reached a shop and has identified the target person or group,
it will announce the advertisement with multiple modalities (e.g., speech + video output on the
on-board screen). After the advertisement, the robot asks if anyone is interested to additional information and if they want to provide their personal information through their fidelity card.
\vspace{1em}
\end{minipage}

 \\ \hline


{\bf Customer  $\rightarrow$ Robot} &
\begin{minipage}{11cm}
\vspace{1em}
If a customer wants to receive additional information, s/he can communicate her/his personal information through her/his fidelity card that will be read by a reader (or a camera on the robot). As an alternative, the user can enter information though a GUI in the touch screen on the robot.
\vspace{1em}
\end{minipage}

\\ \hline

{\bf Robot  $\rightarrow$ Customer} &
\begin{minipage}{11cm}
\vspace{1em}
Once the robot has received information about the person, additional advertisement customized on the user profile will be announced. If they relate to shops far away from the current location, the robot will offer indications about how to reach the place and ask the customer if s/he want to be guided there through speech interaction.
\vspace{1em}
\end{minipage}

\\ \hline

\end{tabular}



\subsubsection*{Use Case 4.1: Customer asks for help carrying his/her bag}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}

\hline
{\bf Manager  $\rightarrow$ Robot} &
\begin{minipage}{11cm}
\vspace{1em}
The manager calls the robot because a customer needs help with a bag.
This communication will be implemented with a remote call through a Web service.
For example, the manager has a Web interface on a tablet to communicate with the robot.
\vspace{1em}
\end{minipage}

\\ \hline

{\bf Robot  $\leftrightarrow$ Customer} &
\begin{minipage}{11cm}
\vspace{1em}
Once the robot has identified the person (for example, because s/he is standing in the dedicated area),
the robot will start a spoken conversation for greeting the person, confirming the intention of carrying the bag, and asking the customer if s/he is in a hurry.
\vspace{1em}
\end{minipage}

 \\ \hline


{\bf Robot  $\rightarrow$ Customer} &
\begin{minipage}{11cm}
\vspace{1em}
If the customer is not in a hurry, the robot will announce (through spoken interaction) additional advertisement when passing close to shops.
\vspace{1em}
\end{minipage}

 \\ \hline

\end{tabular}
