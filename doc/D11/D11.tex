\section{Introduction}

This document consists of describing different principles of the knowledge-based representation that will be used in the development of the knowledge-based reasoning system in WP1. The knowledge base (KB) is used to model both static knowledge (e.g., the semantic map of the environment and the common sense information) and the dynamic knowledge (e.g., human activities) coming from different units, such as the perception modules of the architecture, particularly the multi-modal HRI interface (WP3) and the image processing modules (WP2). 
From these information, the reasoning module should infer the list of possible tasks to accomplish. This list of tasks is then sent to the decision module (WP4) that will compute the behavior policy of the robot to accomplish them. The behavior policy is then sent to the executor module based on Petri Net Plans. 

The general principle is depicted in Figure \ref{WP1principle}.

{\bf TODO: Luca extend the figure as discussed with Esra.}

\section{Design of the knowledge base}

In this section, we define the main features of the knowledge base used in the project. We first introduce the semantic labels used to describe elements of the world, and then predicates that determine relations among these labels.

\subsection{Semantic labels}

In order to refer to objects and classes of objects in the knowledge base, we introduce a set of labels that will be associated to semantic meanings. 

A first set of these labels are called \emph{Concepts} and they are associated to classes of objects. For example, \emph{Restaurant} is a concept used in the semantic map to denote the class of restaurants in the shopping mall. Concept labels always start with an uppercase letter.
These concepts are organized in a hierarchical way according to the ``is-a'' relation.
In this way, we can express, for example, that the concept \emph{FrenchRestaurant} is a \emph{Restaurant}. 

A second set of labels will be used to denote objects. Each object belongs to a concept implementing the relation ``instance-of''. Object labels always start with a lowercase letter.
Thus, a particular restaurant in the mall will be denoted with an object label \emph{caf\'eMarcel} that will be instance of the concept \emph{FrenchRestaurant}. 


\subsection{Predicates}

Predicates are used to describe relations among the semantic labels. For example, the ``is-a'' and the ``instance-of'' relations can be represented by the corresponding predicates {\tt\bf is-a} and {\tt\bf instance-of}. For example, we can write

\begin{quote}
{\tt\bf is-a} ( FrenchRestaurant, Restaurant )\\
{\tt\bf instance-of} ( caf\'eMarcel, FrenchRestaurant )\\
\end{quote}

Sometimes,  the ``is-a'' and the ``instance-of'' relations will be abbreviated respectively by
the operators $\subset$ and $\in$.
Thus, the above example can also be described as \emph{FrenchRestaurant} $\subset$ \emph{Restaurant} and \emph{caf\'eMarcel} $\in$ \emph{FrenchRestaurant}.


Predicates are also used to denote properties of objects. For example, given the concepts \emph{Color} and \emph{Dress} and the objects \emph{red} $\in$ \emph{Color} and \emph{dress\_123} $\in$ \emph{Dress}, the predicate 

\begin{quote}
{\tt\bf color} ( dress\_123,  red )
\end{quote}

\noindent
will represent the color property \emph{red} of the particular object  \emph{dress\_123}.


\section {Representation of the environment}

In this section we present the main concepts (as defined in the previous section) we will consider to represent the status of the environment and to detect events due to external units or human activities. To this end, we consider three types of information: the semantic map (including spatial relations), the common sense knowledge and the human activities.

\subsection{Semantic map}

For the mall map, we consider different types of areas: shops, restaurants, halls, corridors, rest areas, offices, toilettes, etc. For shops, services and restaurants we consider different categories:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\it Shop categories}: dress shop , women dress shop, kid dress shop, men dress shop, makeup store, store perfume, sport store, etc.
\item {\it Restaurant categories}: French, Japanese, Chinese, Italian, Oriental, African, fast-food, etc.
\item {\it Service categories}: security, information, health-care, etc.
\end{itemize}

All these areas are represented as concepts that are grouped in a more general concept \emph{Area}. The hierarchy of these areas will be defined through the ``is-a'' relation of the semantic labels described before.

Doors are also considered as connections of these areas. \emph{Door} is a concept containing door objects and connections of areas through doors are represented with the {\tt\bf connect} predicate (see also below).

\begin{quote}
{\bf\tt connect} ( door12, area1, area2 )
\end{quote}

\noindent
where \emph{door12} $\in$ \emph{Door} \emph{area1}, \emph{area2} $\in$ \emph{Area}  are objects belonging to the corresponding concepts. Moreover, the status of the door can be expressed with a predicate {\tt\bf open}. For example,

\begin{quote}
{\tt\bf open}(door12) \\
\end{quote}




% LI replaced by is-a and instance-of
%\subsection{Type predicate}
%{\tt\bf type}(id, door $\|$ shop $\|$ restaurant $\|$ service $\|$ caf� $\|$ corridor $\|$ rest $\|$ wc)
%\subsection{Category predicate}
%{\tt\bf category}(shop\_id, kid\_dress $\|$ men\_dress$\|$woman\_dress $\|$ dress $\|$ sport $\|$ perfume $\|$ decoration)\\
%{\tt\bf category}(restaurant\_id, fastfood $\|$Italian$\|$French $\|$Chinese $\|$Japenese $\|$ Orient)\\
%{\tt\bf category}(service\_id, Security$\|$information $\|$ healtcare)\\



\paragraph*{\bf Example}~\\

\begin{quote}
{\tt\bf is-a}(FrenchRestaurant, Restaurant) \\
{\tt\bf instance-of}(caf\'eMarcel, FrenchRestaurant) \\
{\tt\bf instance-of}(main\_entrance\_ouest\_1, Door) \\
{\tt\bf instance-of}(hall\_rive\_marin, Hall) \\
\end{quote}


For all the areas, we have to define their localization using a global position referred to a metric map of the environment. We assume to have a 2D absolute reference system in the environment, that will be provided by a 2D SLAM module. Position coordinates of areas and objects are thus expressed in this absolute reference system.

The {\tt\bf position} predicate is used to denote the position of an area or an object in the environment.

\begin{quote}
{\tt\bf position}(area, coordinates)
\end{quote}

\noindent
where \emph{area} $\in$ \emph{Area} and \emph{coordinates} is in general a 2D bounding box of the area, that will enclose the region associated to this area. More precisely, \emph{coordinates} is a sequence of $n$ 2D points in absolute coordinates representing a closed polygon: \emph{coordinates} $\equiv \langle (x_1, y_1) , \ldots, (x_n, y_n) \rangle$.

The {\tt\bf position} predicate is also used to represent a unique position of an object for which the size is not important or it is known or estimated (e.g., a person or a robot). In this case \emph{coordinates} is expressed with only one 2D point. 


\subsubsection{Spatial relations}

In order to represent spatial relations among the elements of the semantic map, we will use a set of predicates, such as:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt\bf in}(person\_id $\|$ object\_id, area\_id)
\item {\tt\bf at}(person\_id $\|$ object\_id, location\_id)
\item {\bf\tt connect} ( area\_id1, area\_id2 )
\item {\bf\tt connect} ( door\_id, area\_id1, area\_id2 )
\item {\tt\bf nearby}(person\_id, area\_id)
\item $\ldots$
\end{itemize}




\subsection{Commonsense knowledge}

\subsection{Human activities}

{\bf TODO: Hichem}

{\bf PLEASE CONSIDER THESE AS JUST EXAMPLES. FEEL FREE TO MODIFY DELETE EVERYTHING}

{\bf Related to image processing}

\begin{itemize}
%\item {\tt\bf Motionless}(person\_id, time\_t, location)
%\item {\tt\bf Request} (request\_id,request\_type, person\_id, location\_t) where {\it Request\_type}  could be escorting\_to(location),informing\_about(area\_id), guiding\_to(location)
%\item {\tt\bf Rest\_Area} (person\_id, time\_t, location)

\item {\tt\bf motionless} (person\_id)
\item {\tt\bf empty} (location\_id)
\item {\tt\bf crowded} (location\_id)
\item {\tt\bf approaching} (person\_id, location\_id)
\item {\tt\bf approaching} (person\_id, robot\_id)
\item $\ldots$


\end{itemize}



{\bf Related to HRI}


\begin{itemize}

\item {\tt\bf asking-for-help} (person\_id)
\item {\tt\bf in-conversation} (person\_id, robot\_id)
\item $\ldots$

\end{itemize}


\vspace{3cm}



\subsection{Events}

{\bf TODO Later}


\subsubsection{Event Definition}
  \begin{defn}
  An {\bf Event} is a tuple defined by the actor of the event, where the event has been occurred, when and what is the semantic of the event described by spatio-temporal relations or human activities. 
  \[ Event = <actor, location, time, semantic> \] 
  where semantic = At $\|$ In $\|$ Infrontof $\|$ motionless $\|$ rest\_area $\|$ request \\
  \end{defn}
   \subsubsection{Event-based reasoning and goal generation}
   From the list of predicates and events, we create a list of goals to send to the decision module. In the following these are some commonsense rules to generate goals. 
   \begin{itemize}
\item  {\bf joint escorting goal generation}: \\
  If request\_type=escorting\_to(location) and in(location,hall\_id1) and in(robot, hall\_id2) and hall\_id1 $\neq$ hall\_id2 then \\
  add(list\_goal, create\_task (task\_id joint\_escorting\_task, hall\_id2, hall\_id1, location))
\item  {\bf Surveillance goal generation} \\
  If event(object\_id,location,time\_t,in(object\_id,hall\_id)) then \\
  add(list\_goal, create\_task(task\_id, surveillance\_task, location, object\_id))
\item {\bf Advertising goal generation} \\
   If event(person\_id,location,time\_t,infrontof(person\_id, shop\_id) then \\
   add(list\_goal, create\_task(task\_id, advertising\_task, location, person\_id, shop\_id)
\item $\dots$
   \end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
  
This draft describes in an abstract way what we can expect to have in the KB module. Many concepts should be defined and deepened to provide an effective reasoning module. Representation and reasoning techniques should be discussed. Many commonsense reasoning rules should be defined, spatial reasoning and computation of spatial relations from robot and people locations have to be defined. This could also be discussed in the next phone meeting.
