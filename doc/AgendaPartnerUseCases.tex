\section{Introduction}
 We describe in details for each use case what to do, which work pages are involved and which task should be accomplished, who should accomplish  the tasks, mentioning the partners involved and when to deliver the software.    

\section{Work plan of use cases}
\subsection{USE CASE 1, 1.1:  Advertising at points of interests (visitor or group of visitors)}
\paragraph{\bf Functions:} detecting a person or a group of persons by external data, sending features with location to KB module, updating the KB  and creating a goal to send to the decision module . Decision module creates a policy to execute and invoke some modules of  multi-modal interaction. In this case is advertising using a base of advertising coming from the mall. \\
\paragraph{Involved WPs:}
\begin{itemize}
\item WP1:  creating task of advertisement
\item WP2: detecting (one) person and a group 
\item WP3: GUI
\item WP4: decision-making transforming the task in a PRU+ structure and then deriving a policy. 
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{\bf Status of required modules:}
\begin{itemize}
\item WP1: a simple version exists that could be improved and having a new version at the end of the summer
\item WP2: missing and expecting a module of person and group detection at the end of summer
\item WP3: a GUI could be available at the end of summer
\item WP4: a module is available
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Who do what and when ?}
\begin{itemize} 
\item Sebanci ; what : improving module KB ; when: end of the summer (August)
\item Vub and/or GREYC(post-doc): module of detecting a person and a group of persons (August)
\item Sapienza: GUI (August)
\item GREYC: Integrating the module in the whole architecture (August)
\item Demonstration at the mall: November 2015
\end{itemize}
\subsection{ USE CASE 1, 1.2: Intercepting a person, dialogue and assistances}
\paragraph{Functions:} detecting a person or a group of persons by external camera, sending features with location to KB module, updating the KB  and creating a goal to send to the decision module. Decision module creates a policy to execute and invoke some modules of multi-modal interaction. In this case is a dialogue to assess the need of the person and considering a guiding on the screen.
\paragraph{\bf Involved WPs:}
\begin{itemize} 
\item  WP1:  creating task of advertisement
\item  WP2: done in 1.1 
\item  WP3: GUI and speech for dialogue
\item  WP4: decision-making transforming the task in a PRU+ structure and then deriving a policy. 
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Status of required modules:}
\begin{itemize} 
\item WP1: semantic map to finalize
\item WP2: missing and expecting a module of person and group detection at the end of summer
\item WP3: Speech 
\item WP4: a module is available
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{\bf Who do what and when ?} 
\begin{itemize} 
\item Sebanci/GREYC ; what : semantic map ;  end of the summer (August) a first version (even partial)
\item Vub and/or GREYC(post-doc): module of detecting a person and a group of persons (August) the same as in the previous case
 \item Sapienza: Speech (August)
 \item GREYC: Integrating the module in the whole architecture (August) with dialogue
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{\bf First demonstration at the mall (advertising):} November 2015
\paragraph{\bf Second demonstration at the mall (guiding):}  Spring 2016
\paragraph{\bf Third demonstration at the mall (first version of escorting): } Summer 2016

\subsection{USE CASE 2: Detecting abnormal events (wet floor flag for security and human activities)}
\paragraph{\bf Functions:} detecting a wet floor flag used by the cleaning unit or a motionlness and hesitation behavior ;  sending the information to KB module. This latter updates the KB and send a goal of securing the area to the decision module. Decision module creates a policy to execute and can invoke some modules of multi-modal interaction. In this case is the use of speech to announce the danger (considering the use of a warning light or speech) and dialogue to assess the need and then assist
\paragraph{\bf Involved WPs:} 
\begin{itemize} 
\item WP1:  creating task of advertisement
\item WP2: done in 1.1 
\item WP3: GUI and speech for dialogue
\item WP4: decision-making transforming the task in a PRU+ structure and then deriving a policy. 
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{\bf Status of required modules:}
\begin{itemize} 
\item WP1: KB updating
\item WP2: detecting landmarks and human activities (Fall 2016)
\item WP3: Speech 
\item WP4: a module is available
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{\bf  Who do what and when ?}
\begin{itemize} 
\item Sebanci: KB updating reasoning (Spring 2016)
\item Vub and/or GREYC(post-doc): landmarks detection (fall 2016)
\item Sapienza: Speech (August 2015)
\item GREYC: Integrating the module in the whole architecture (August 2015) with dialogue
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{\bf First demonstration at the mall (warning):} Fall 2016
\subsection{USE CASE 3:  Multi-robot scenario}
\paragraph{\bf Functions:} Task allocation (sharing assistance) and joint tasks (escorting and security) . First example of task allocation with two robots in the same mall and share different assistance task and second example concerns the joint task such as escorting for one building to another with two robots and securing an area with two robots. 
\paragraph{\bf Involved WPs:}
$\bullet$~WP4: Extension of WP4 to multi-robots
\paragraph{\bf Status of required modules:}
\begin{itemize} 
\item WP1: KB updating and creating joint task
\item WP4: Decentralized decision-making (Spring 2016)
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{\bf Who do what and when ?}
\begin{itemize} 
\item Sebanci and GREYC: reasoning on Joint tasks (summer 2016)
\item GREYC: Decentralized decision making (Spring 2016)
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{\bf Demonstration at the mall with multi-robot} (Fall 2016)
\subsection{USE CASE 4}
 This use case is let to the future and updating what is described in the  derivable according to the progress made on the use cases described in this document.
