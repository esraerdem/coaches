In this paper we have presented our architecture for personalized
sort-term human-robot interaction. Robot actions have been described
through PNPs that can be dynamically adapted according to the user
profile and a set of domain-independent social norms. This provides
the system with a high level of scalability and, as shown in our
examples, allows for being easily extended to a variety of interactions.
