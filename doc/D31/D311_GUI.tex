\section{GUI sub-system}

The GUI sub-system implements a graphical input and output interface between users and robots. The GUI defines actions (i.e., output operations) and conditions (i.e., input operations) that are integrated in the DM with other communication primitives (e.g., speech) in order to implement a multi-modal interaction.



The GUI sub-system implements and provide to the DM the following elements:

\begin{description}
\item[\emph{Show}]: actions that allow the robot to show information (text, images, videos, or other multi-media) to the user through the screen.
\item[\emph{GUI}]: conditions associated to GUI input elements that enable conditional branching in the PNP behavior.
\end{description}
