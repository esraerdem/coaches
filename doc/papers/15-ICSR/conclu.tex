\section{Conclusions}
\vspace{-0.1cm}
In this paper we have presented our architecture for personalized
short-term human-robot interaction. Robot actions have been described
through PNPs that can be dynamically adapted according to the user
profile and a set of domain-independent social norms. This provides
the system with a high level of scalability and, as shown in our
examples, allows for being easily extended to a variety of interactions.

The on-going {\coaches} project is the main experimental test-bed for the work presented in this paper. Future work thus include a user study, whose main focus will be assessing improved acceptance of a social robot with personalized interactions. With the approach described in this paper, producing different versions of the interaction behavior of the robot is as easy as adding or removing a social norm.
